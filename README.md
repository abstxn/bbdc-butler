# BBDC Bookings Helper

This script helps you search for bookings, and will message you on Telegram if a booking meeting your requirements has been found.

Currently a lot of hard-coding is present in the main code.

`mv .dummy_config .config` and replace fields in `.config` with your personal details like username, password, the token of your Telegram bot, and your Telegram ID (if you want notifications).

Instructions to setup Telegram notifications not included.
